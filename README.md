 INTRODUCTION

This site was created to be a simple and accessible booking and viewing space for anyone from industry, school or clubs to book our creative services at a glance. A lot is yet to be developed, however you are able to see the services provided and immediately send a request or query which can be received and responded to within 24hrs. Papilion is a creative community of consultants from many backgrounds and walks of life. We believe our knowledge and collective 50years of experience in art, theatre, dance, music, community engagement and group development can help you and your organisation reach positive and progressive outcomes, whatever your target or goal.
