### Overview

Papilion is a creative community of consultant artists from many backgrounds and walks of life. We believe our knowledge and collective 50years of experience in art, theatre, dance, music, community engagement and group development can help you and your organisation reach positive and progressive outcomes, whatever your target or goal


### Description

This site was created to be a simple and accessible booking and viewing space for anyone from industry, school or clubs to book our creative services at a glance. A lot is yet to be developed, however you are able to see the services provided and immediately send a request or query which can be received and responded to within 24hrs.

## UX


#### User Stories

- *"As a User I would like to know other customer experiences on this site"*

- *"As a User and “”*

- *"We are keen to get involved, but would like to contact someone via email to discuss in more depth"*


#### 1.	Strategy

The aim of this site is that people can immediately contact us to book a workshop or query the available services.


##### Project Goals:

- Sell more creative workshops

- Inform the customer on what services are available and why they should choose us

- Facilitate contact through online forms


##### Customer Goals:

- Immediate information on service available 

- Ability to book a timely consultation
	
- Option to request more information


#### 2.	Scope

The site is predominantly a booking site for physical creative workshops:

- Branding colours with easy to read content

- Motion in the form of a carousel of images

- 5-page with links from navigation and services in index.html, a big booking button 

- A query and booking form

- Location via a map

- Contact email address


#### 3.	Structure

The structure is aimed at easy practical access to short succinct info on each service.

For the merely curious they can contact us via the query form and for those who know what they want, a booking form is provided with a calendar to book specific dates. Images of activities we provide and a direct booking button is also available.


#### 4.	Skeleton Surface

- Wireframes: clearly defined 4-page site

- Fixed navigation bar for easy reference to pages

- Main(Home) page, About (Support Options) page, Image Gallery page and Contact page with donation options

- Contact Form

- Footer with Social Media

![About page](https://github.com/…)

![Gallery page](https://github.com/…)

![Contact page](https://github.com/…)


#### 5. 	Surface

I have opted for a simple clean approach with the images selling our service. The idea being customers would be enthused by the images, find the service they personally require and immediately book a consultation.

##### Existing Features


* Feature 1 - Intro - “Home” logo will always take you back to the homepage wherever you are on the site

* Feature 2 - Links - These allow the user to go to the relevant information for them specifically, without needing to scroll through the entire site.

* Feature 3 - Navigation - easy navigation with a fixed, direct navigation links to topic/service (theatre, dance, music and art)page and section, navbar hover-highlight style for better navigation

* Feature 4 - Booking - This allows the user to easily find the dates of Orthodox Easter for the next three years so that they can book their holiday appropriately.

* Feature 5 - Social  - These are direct links to social networks, each links directly to the project site which opens on a separate page. The only generic link is LinkedIn.


## __Future Goals__

Wishlist of future ideas to be implemented at a future date:

* Chat

It would be a service benefit and potential sales angle to have live chat, or at least a Bot to to give FAQs

* Online Resource 

For teachers and team leaders, an online resource package preparing the groups for workshop visits

* Map  

I would like to integrate a more interactive map than is presently available. Users should be available to, for safety, see the location and surroundings of the theatre venue where we are based and where most workshops happen.

* Booking  

I would like to create a better system so users can book by checking available slots and creating a payment system to assist in service and sales handling. 


### Testing

The first few commits were big structural dumps, testing the skeleton structure and then the skeleton with placeholders. As I started to apply the ‘hamburger modal’ from the ’Whiskey’ project and the Bootstrap Carousel, found conflicting code. 


### Bugs

.theia directory was missing, along with docker file, so replaced these by downloading correct directories and files from CI template and uploaded into Gitpod
