## INTRODUCTION


**This site was created to be a simple and accessible booking and viewing space for anyone from industry, school or clubs to book our creative services at a glance. A lot is yet to be developed, however you are able to see the services provided and immediately send a request or query which can be received and responded to within 24hrs. Papilion is a creative community of consultants from many backgrounds and walks of life. We believe our knowledge and collective 50years of experience in art, theatre, dance, music, community engagement and group development can help you and your organisation reach positive and progressive outcomes, whatever your target or goal**

## Project Scope


**The idea to create this new site was simple. I had some great images to work with and an idea from a previous attempt with a Wordpress template several years ago. Later, I intend to add a more interactive Gallery, and some videos of Customer Satisfaction. I have considered incorporating an online resource for trials and pre-workshop bookings too.**

## Features


**So far, the key Features are the social links which allow our clients to access a visual experience of our previous works, the Hover in the navbar is very satisfying as it is glided over. Another great Feature is the Hamburger menu when mobile.**

## Users


**In the process of creating this new site i was thinking about the requirements of the User. Why did they come to this website? why would they stay? how easy have i made it for them to peruse and in so doing fulfil my purpose for creating site in the first instance. I want to sell workshops.** 

**The way i have chosen to do this is by providing enough content for them to understand our services, recognise their choices in the consistent manner of the 'Book Us Now' presence throughout the site. For the curious we have a query area.**

**Some thoughts from interested parties:**

- As a User I would to know other customer experiences on this site 
  
  A. Thankyou User. A 'Customer Satisfaction' section is under-consideration. Would you find it more convenient in the 'About Us' section or as another navigation button? 

- As a User I think your site is a bit neutral. I would like to see some movement and maybe catch a sense of the workshop atmosphere.
  
  A. Thankyou for your comment and a great idea! In the meantime please check out https://youtu.be/J0WSZuVI3GM for some of our great videos.**

## Technology

**As this my first fully operational site I used:**

  - Bootstrap: I found this useful but had to edit aspects of the modal to make the BOOK Now work and navbar to fit properly. I am still unable to move or centralise the Book Now header in the booking form
  - HTML: I am proficient 
  - CSS: this has been a learning experience as I had not worked a great deal with CSS. Styling the pages and learning the color code was very helpful.
  - Fontawesome - <*---fontawesome website---*>
